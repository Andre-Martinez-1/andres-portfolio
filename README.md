# andres-portfolio

## Description

My personal webpage to archive my projects. To demonstrate my portfolio I wanted to create a page that contained not only a title but a navigation or table contents that would allow the user to click and be taken to a specific location.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

I used HTML to create my framework, I tried to include a good amount of sections, articles, and classes to help add structure for my CSS to follow.
A challenge for sure.
